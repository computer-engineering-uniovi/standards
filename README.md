# Oviedo Computing Community Style Guides

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project holds the style guidelines we use for this community code. If you are modifying a project that originated at this community, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides that apply to that project.

### How do I contribute.
